    "Python is a programming language, and programming language is a formal language used to communicate with computers. It allows you to write instructions or code that a computer can understand and execute to perform specific tasks or solve problems. As an astrophysics student, programming can be a powerful tool to help you analyze and visualize data, simulate physical systems, and develop computational models.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Versatility:** Python is a versatile programming language that can be used for various tasks, including data analysis, simulations, and machine learning. This makes it a useful tool for a wide range of astrophysical applications.\n",
    "- **Large community and resources:** Python has a large community of developers and users, which means there are many resources and libraries available. For example, there are specialized libraries for astrophysicists to analzye spectra, photometric data, interact with astronomical databases throgh API and much more (check out [Astropy Project](https://www.astropy.org/affiliated/index.html) where you can find a list of all supported packages). Astrophysicists also use [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [scipy](https://scipy.org/), [matplolib](https://matplotlib.org/) and other libraries very extensively. This saves time and allows us to focus on our research objective rather than reinventing the wheel.\n",
    "- **User-friendly:** Python is relatively easy to learn and use, with a clear syntax and readable code. This makes it accessible to scientists who may not have a background in programming.\n",
    "- **Free and open-source:** Python is free to use and open-source, which means that anyone can use it, modify it, and contribute to its development. This fosters collaboration and innovation within the scientific community."
